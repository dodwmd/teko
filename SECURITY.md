## Security Measures

### API Key Management
- All API keys are stored securely using Laravel's environment variables
- Production keys are never committed to the repository
- API keys have limited scopes and permissions

### Access Controls
- Role-based access control using Laravel Entrust
- Regular permission audits
- Secure authentication via Laravel Socialite

### Security Updates
- Dependencies are regularly updated to patch security vulnerabilities
- Automated security scanning is performed on all pull requests
- Weekly security scans are performed on the main branch

### Data Protection
- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Regular backups are performed
- Access to production data is strictly controlled

## Security Considerations for AI Components
- LangChain and AI agent operations are sandboxed
- Input validation and sanitization for all AI interactions
- Secure storage of AI model access tokens
- Rate limiting for AI operations
- Monitoring for unusual behavior or requests
